# SciFiWatchlist
This project was created in a team environment using Agile/Scrum methodology.
It was created a portion of a larger application titled AppBuilder9000.<br>
<br>
The SciFiWatchlist allows the users to create a list of SciFi movies that they intend to watch. It also populates a list of suggestions by inserting a list of the top 100 SciFi movies using data scraped from the Rotten Tomatoes site via BeautifulSoup.
